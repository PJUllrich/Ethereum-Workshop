# Ethereum Workshop
This is an introductory workshop for how to develop Ethereum smart contracts with Python3.
The popular Python library [`Populus`](http://populus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) will be used to test and deploy smart contracts. Smart contracts are generally written in [`Solidity`](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) which is a programming language specifically developed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this project into a new folder on your machine with e.g. `git clone git@github.com:PJUllrich/Ethereum-Workshop.git`
1. Create a new Virtual Environment with Python 3.5 or later. [This article](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv) explains how.
1. Activate your Virtual Environment as described in the article.
1. Install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
